### Description

Hello, this is mi solution to a technical test, in which, you have to create an app connected to an external API and show results from it.

To saw it in local, you need to clone the repository, introduce `npm install` and execute `npm start` in the terminal and it will be open in [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## Technical Requirements:

[x] The app should be done in React

[x] The app should be compatible with IE11+.

## Non-Requirements developed:

[x] Image of the films: Using a JSON i added the image url of the movie. 

## Bonus Requirements developed:

[x] Mobile support: I used `SASS` to adapt the web so it could be `Responsive` and available in all devices.

[x] User interface: Ghibli Studios films are quite famous for their animation so i tried to put a litle bit of their magic in the interface of the App.

[x] Performance (loading and rendering): The app will bring the data from the API. Using states and props the data can be show to the user all the time.

## Bonus Requirements undeveloped:

[ ] Testing: I don't have much practice in testing with Javascript yet, so i wasn't sure how to do it. But it will be an issue that will be solved in the future.
